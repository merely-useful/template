# Overall Design

-   Markdown source files for each human language are in a [Jekyll collection][jekyll-collections] named after the language.
    -   E.g., `_en` for English.

-   Every file has a unique slug.  Using the English version as an example:
    -   The entry in the Jekyll configuration's table of contents is `slug`.
    -   The file's name is `./_en/slug.md` (so the file's auto-generated slug is `slug`).
    -   The generated HTML file is `./_site/en/slug/index.html` (so the URL is `http://whatever/slug/`).
    -   The chapter ID `s:slug` is inserted automatically.
    -   All section IDs are `s:slug-something` (and must be written manually).
    -   The figure IDs are `f:slug-something`.
    -   The source for all diagrams for the file is in `./figures/slug.xml` (a [draw.io][draw-io] drawing).
    -   The PNG, SVG, and PDF versions of the diagrams are in `./figures/slug_something.suffix`.

-   Every Markdown file's YAML must contain one field:
    -   `title`: the file's title.

-   Lessons must also contain three lists (all Markdown-formatted):
    -   `questions`: a point-form list of motivating questions.
    -   `objectives`: a point-form list of learning objectives.
    -   `keypoints`: a point-form list of key points for a cheat sheet.

-   The `index.md` file for each language (e.g., `_en/index.md`) must also contain:
    -   `root: true` to control formatting.
    -   `permalink: "/en/"` (or whatever the language is) to override the default output path defined in `_config.yml`.
    -   This file becomes `./_site/en/index.html` (or whatever the language is).

-   The `index.md` file for one language should contain:
    -   `redirect: '/'` so that going to `http://whatever/` redirects to `http://whatever/en/` (or whatever the language is).

-   The goal was to use pure Jekyll to create HTML for GitHub Pages without having to commit any generated files.
    -   We came close, but we can't access section headings within files in Jekyll,
        so we wouldn't be able to use cross-references to sections (only to chapters).
    -   So we need to regenerate the table of contents in `./_data/toc.json` with a compilation step and commit that.
    -   Since we're doing that,
        we also use a script to regenerate the Markdown bibliography (e.g., `./_en/bib.md`)
        from the BibTeX source (e.g., `./tex/en/book.bib`).

-   Use Pandoc with pre- and post-processing to convert HTML to LaTeX to build PDF.
    -   Run `bin/transform.py --pre` to read the HTML in (for example) `./_site/en/.../*.html`
        and generate a stream with markers for problematic elements.
    -   Run this through Pandoc to do HTML-to-LaTeX conversion.
    -   Run `bin/transform.py --post` to find and convert the markers.
    -   It's clumsy, but easier to maintain than a custom Pandoc template
        (we know more Python programmers than Pandoc experts).

-   Use the JavaScript in `./assets/site.js` to:
    -   Add a disclaimer to the HTML version if `site.disclaimer` is set true in `./_config.yml`.
    -   Create a table of contents for each page.
    -   Patch up classes for tables.
    -   Fix cross-references and references to bibliography items and glossary entries.

-   `./_includes/summary.html` and `./_includes/toc-section.html` loop over the table of contents to match slugs to files
    because Jekyll doesn't support lookup by field in collections.
    -   This makes Jekyll's running time O(N^2), but there's nothing we can do about it.

## Configuration Entries

The top half of `./_config.yml` should look like this:

```
# Display.
title: "A Merely Useful Template"
subtitle: "Build a GitHub Pages Site and a Nicely-Formatted Book from the Same Source"
editor: "Greg Wilson"
copyrightyear: "2019"
repo: "https://github.com/merely-useful/template"
website: "https://merely-useful.github.io/template/"
email: "gvwilson@third-bit.com"
organization: https://github.com/merely-useful/
disclaimer: true

# Order for table of contents.
toc:
  lessons:
  - intro
  bib:
  - bib
  extras:
  - license
  - conduct
  - citation
  - contributing
  - gloss
  - objectives
  - keypoints
```

The keys under `Display` should be self-explanatory.
The keys under `toc` *must* be `lessons`, `bib`, and `extras` in that order;
the only entry allowed under `bib` is `bib`,
and all of the entries shown under `extras` should be there
(though others may be added).
The main index file (e.g., `_en/index.md`) is *not* included in the table of contents.

## Typography

-   Refer to glossary entries using `{% raw %}[text](#g:key){% endraw %}`.
    -   This minimizes typing: without it, glossary entries would all need `../gloss/` in the path.
    -   The JavaScript in `./assets/site.js` patches these references and sets the style for glossary references when the page loads.
    -   Knows which ones to patch by looking for the leading `g:` in the reference.

-   Bibliographic citations are written using `{% raw %}[Name1901,Name2001](#BIB){% endraw %}`.
    -   Deliberately similar to LaTeX's `\cite{Name1901,Name2001}`.
    -   Again, `./assets/site.js` turns this into links into the bibligraphy: the `#BIB` link identifies elements to be modified.

-   Cross-references are written using `{% raw %}[s:whatever](#REF){% endraw %}`.
    -   `./assets/site.js` relies on an up-to-date cross-reference file `./_data/en_toc.json` to fix these
        (with some other language prefix in place of `en` if necessary).

-   External links are `[text][link-name]`, where `link-name` is a key in `./_includes/links.md`
    -   `./_includes/links.md` has to be included explicitly at the bottom of every Markdown file
        because including it in the template doesn't work
        (links are expanded before the inclusion is processed).

-   Use `{% raw %}{% include figure.html id="f:whatever" src="../../figures/whatever.svg" caption="Whatever" %}{% endraw %}`
    to include a figure.
    -   `./_includes/figure.html` translates this into HTML for use in Markdown.
    -   `./bin/transform.py` takes care of the LaTeX.

-   Use underscores rather than dashes in filenames, e.g., `a_b.md`.
    -   Need underscores for Python source files that are being imported.
    -   Might as well be consistent.
    -   Should probably switch all cross-reference keys to underscores as well...

-   If you would like to add code fragments,
    please put the source in `./src/chapter/long-name.ext`.
    Include it in a left-justified, triple-backquoted code block.
    -   Fenced code blocks *must* have a language type.
    -   `html` for HTML
    -   `js` for JavaScript and JSON
    -   `make` for Makefiles
    -   `python` for Python
    -   `r` for R
    -   `shell` for shell commands
    -   `yaml` for YAML
    -   `text` for output (including error output) and everything else.

-   If you want to leave out sections of code,
    use `# ...explanation...` (i.e., a comment with triple dots enclosing the text)
    in the Markdown file.

-   If you would like to add or fix a diagram, please:
    1.  Edit the XML file in `./figures/` corresponding to the chapter using [draw.io][draw-io].
    2.  Select the drawing and export as SVG with a 4-pixel boundary and transparency turned on,
        but *without* including the diagram source in the exported SVG.
    3.  Export a second time as PDF (selection only, cropped).
        We have tried automating the SVG-to-PDF conversion with various tools,
        but the results have been unsatisfying.
    4.  Edit the Markdown file and include an HTML `figure` element with an ID
        containing (in order) an `img` element with a `src` attribute but nothing else
        and a `figcaption` element with the figure's label.
        **These elements all have to be on one line**
        so that `./bin/transform.py` can find and translate the elements correctly.

-   When all else fails, put `<div markdown="1" replacement="something.tex">` in the Markdown file
    and a corresponding `</div>` after the block of Markdown that's to be replaced by
    the LaTeX inclusion.
    This can be used for complex tables,
    for displaying MathJax,
    and so on.

## Layout

-   `./README.md`: this file.
    -   Not processed by Jekyll.
-   `./CITATION.md`, `./CONDUCT.md`, `./LICENSE.md`: how to cite, code of conduct, and license respectively.
    -   Not processed by Jekyll.
    -   Redundant (information is also in `./_en/filename.md`) but people expect to find these in the root directory.
-   `./Makefile`: re-build everything.
    -   `make` prints a list of targets.
    -   Can regenerate HTML and PDF, check file consistency, count words, etc.
    -   Use `make lang=xx` to run commands for a particular human language (e.g., `make lang=en` to build the English version).
-   `./_config.yml`: Jekyll configuration file.
    -   Simple values defined at the top (e.g., `title` and `subtitle`).
    -   `toc` is table of contents, and has three sub-keys:
        -   `lessons` for the main body.
        -   `bib` for the bibliography (single entry).
        -   `extras` for appendices.
        -    Each entry must match a file's slug.
    -   Read about [Jekyll collections][jekyll-collections] to understand the following:
        -   The use of `output: true` to force output.
        -   The use of `permalink: /:collection/:title/` to turn `_en/something.md` into `_site/en/something/index.html`.
        -   The use of `defaults` to specify the `lesson` layout for all the files in `_en`.
            -   Except `toc.json`, which uses `layout: none`.
