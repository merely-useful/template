Contributions of all kinds are welcome, from errata and minor improvements to
entirely new sections and chapters: please [email us][config-email] or submit an
issue or pull request to [our GitHub repository][config-repo].  Everyone whose
work is incorporated will be acknowledged; please note that all contributors are
required to abide by our Code of Conduct ([s:conduct](#REF)).

The [Jekyll][jekyll] template used in this tutorial can support multiple
languages.  All English content should go in the `_en` directory.  (Please note
that we use Simplified English rather than Traditional English, i.e., American
rather than British spelling and grammar.)  We encourage translations; if you
would like to take this on, please [email us][config-email].

If you wish to report errata or suggest improvements to wording, please include
the chapter name in the first line of the body of your report (e.g., `Testing
Data Analysis`).
