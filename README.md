# A Merely Useful GitHub Pages Template

## Overall Design

-   Markdown source files for each human language are in a [Jekyll collection][jekyll-collections] named after the language.
    -   E.g., `_en` for English.

-   Every file has a unique slug.  Using the English version as an example:
    -   The entry in the Jekyll configuration's table of contents is `slug`.
    -   The file's name is `./_en/slug.md` (so the file's auto-generated slug is `slug`).
    -   The generated HTML file is `./_site/en/slug/index.html`.
    -   The chapter ID is `s:slug` and all section IDs are `s:slug-something`.
    -   The figure IDs are `f:slug-something`.
    -   The source for all diagrams for the file is in `./figures/slug.xml` (a [draw.io][draw-io] drawing).
    -   The PNG, SVG, and PDF versions of the diagrams are in `./figures/slug_something.suffix`.

-   Every Markdown file's YAML must contain one field:
    -   `title`: the file's title.

-   Lessons must also contain:
    -   `questions`: a point-form list of motivating questions.
    -   `objectives`: a point-form list of learning objectives.
    -   `keypoints`: a point-form list of key points for a cheat sheet.

-   The `index.md` file for each language (e.g., `_en/index.md`) must also contain:
    -   `root: true` to control formatting.
    -   `permalink: "/en/"` (or whatever the language is) to override the default output path defined in `_config.yml`.
    -   This file becomes `./_site/en/index.html` (or whatever the language is).

-   The goal was to use pure Jekyll to create HTML for GitHub Pages without having to commit any generated files.
    -   Came close but failed: we can't access section headings within files in Jekyll,
        so we wouldn't be able to refer to sections (only to chapters).
    -   So we need to regenerate the table of contents in `./_data/toc.json` with a compilation step and commit that.
    -   We also use a script to regenerate the Markdown bibliography (e.g., `./_en/bib.md`) from the BibTeX source (e.g., `./tex/en/book.bib`).

-   Use the JavaScript in `./assets/site.js` to:
    -   Add a disclaimer to the HTML version.
    -   Create a table of contents for each page.
    -   Patch up classes for tables.
    -   Fix cross-references and references to bibliography items and glossary entries.

-   Refer to glossary entries using `{% raw %}[text](#g:key){% endraw %}`.
    -   This minimizes typing: without it, glossary entries would all need `../gloss/` in the path, which isn't horrible, but...
    -   The JavaScript in `./assets/site.js` patches these references and sets the style for glossary references when the page loads.
    -   Knows which ones to patch by looking for the leading `g:` in the reference.

-   Bibliographic citations are written using `{% raw %}[Name1901,Name2001](#BIB){% endraw %}`.
    -   Deliberately similar to LaTeX's `\cite{Name1901,Name2001}`.
    -   Again, `./assets/site.js` turns this into links into the bibligraphy: the `#BIB` link identifies elements to be modified.

-   Cross-references are written using `{% raw %}[s:whatever](#REF){% endraw %}`.
    -   `./assets/site.js` relies on an up-to-date table of contents to fix these.

-   External links are `[text][link-name]`, where `link-name` is a key in `./_includes/links.md`
    -   `./_includes/links.md` is included explicitly at the bottom of every Markdown file because including it in the template doesn't work.

-   Some inclusions loop over the table of contents to match slugs to files because Jekyll doesn't support lookup by key in collections.

-   Use Pandoc with pre- and post-processing to convert HTML to LaTeX to build PDF.
    -   Run `bin/transform.py --pre` to read the HTML in (for example) `./_site/en/.../*.html` and generate a stream with markers for problematic elements.
    -   Run this through Pandoc to do HTML-to-LaTeX conversion.
    -   Run `bin/transform.py --post` to find and convert the markers.
    -   It's clumsy, but easier to maintain than a custom Pandoc template.

## Typography

-   Use underscores rather than dashes in filenames, e.g., `a_b.md`.
    -   Need underscores for Python source files that are being loaded.
    -   Might as well be consistent.

-   If you would like to add code fragments,
    please put the source in `./src/chapter/long-name.ext`.
    Include it in a left-justified, triple-backquoted code block:
    use `python` for Python, `r` for R, `shell` for shell commands, `html` for HTML,
    and `text` for output (including error output), YAML, and and other things.

-   If you want to leave out sections of code,
    use `# ...explanation...` (i.e., a comment with triple dots enclosing the text)
    in the Markdown file.

-   If you would like to add or fix a diagram, please:
    1.  Edit the XML file in `./figures/` corresponding to the chapter using [draw.io][draw-io].
    2.  Select the drawing and export as SVG with a 4-pixel boundary and transparency turned on,
        but *without* including the diagram source in the exported SVG.
    3.  Export a second time as PDF (selection only, cropped).
        We have tried automating the SVG-to-PDF conversion with various tools,
        but the results have been unsatisfying.
    4.  Edit the Markdown file and include an HTML `figure` element with an ID
        containing (in order) an `img` element with a `src` attribute but nothing else
        and a `figcaption` element with the figure's label.
        **These elements all have to be on one line**
        so that `./bin/transform.py` can find and translate the elements correctly.

-   When all else fails, put `<div markdown="1" replacement="something.tex">` in the Markdown file
    and a corresponding `</div>` after the block of Markdown that's to be replaced by
    the LaTeX inclusion.
    This can be used for complex tables,
    for displaying MathJax,
    and so on.

## Layout

-   `./README.md`: this file.
    -   Not processed by Jekyll.
-   `./CITATION.md`, `./CONDUCT.md`, `./LICENSE.md`: how to cite, code of conduct, and license respectively.
    -   Not processed by Jekyll.
    -   Redundant (information is also in `./_en/filename.md`) but people expect to find these in the root directory.
-   `./Makefile`: re-build everything.
    -   `make` prints a list of targets.
    -   Can regenerate HTML and PDF, check file consistency, count words, etc.
    -   Use `make lang=xx` to run commands for a particular human language (e.g., `make lang=en` to build the English version).
-   `./_config.yml`: Jekyll configuration file.
    -   Simple values defined at the top (e.g., `title` and `subtitle`).
    -   `toc` is table of contents, and has three sub-keys:
        -   `lessons` for the main body.
        -   `bib` for the bibliography (single entry).
        -   `extras` for appendices.
        -    Each entry must match a file's slug.
    -   Read about [Jekyll collections][jekyll-collections] to understand the following:
        -   The use of `output: true` to force output.
        -   The use of `permalink: /:collection/:title/` to turn `_en/something.md` into `_site/en/something/index.html`.
        -   The use of `defaults` to specify the `lesson` layout for all the files in `_en`.
            -   Except `toc.json`, which uses `layout: none`.
-   `./_data/lang_toc.json`: JSON-formatted table of contents data.
-   `./_en/`: English-language collection of Markdown files.
-   `./_includes/`: inclusions
    -   `./_includes/disclaimer.html`: temporary disclaimer about files being under development.
    -   `./_includes/foot.html`: everything needed in the foot of the page.
    -   `./_includes/head.html`: everything needed in the head of the page that doesn't depend on configuration variables.
    -   `./_includes/links.md`: table of Markdown-formatted links.
    -   `./_includes/listblock.html`: displays a point-form list of lesson metadata (e.g., questions or key points).
    -   `./_includes/summary.html`: summarizes metadata from all lessons (e.g., creates a page of learning objectives).
    -   `./_includes/toc-bib.html`: display the bibliography in the table of contents.
    -   `./_includes/toc-section.html`: display lessons or extras in the table of contents.
    -   `./_includes/toc.html`: display the entire table of contents.
    -   `./_includes/slug/file.ext`: an inclusion for the lesson with that slug.
-   `./_layouts/`: page layouts.
    -   `./_layouts/default.html`: base layout (used directly only for the overall index page for the whole site).
    -   `./_layouts/lesson.html`: derived layout for all lesson pages.
-   `./_site/`: if present, holds the HTML pages generated by Jekyll.
-   `./all/`: holds the placeholder files used for the all-in-one versions of the site (per language).
    -   E.g., `./all/en.html` becomes `_site/en/all/index.html`.
    -   Placed here rather than in the language directory `_en` because it needs to be handled specially.
-   `./bin/`: scripts used to build and check the site.
    -   `./bin/bib2md.py`: convert BibTeX bibliography to Markdown.
    -   `./bin/check_chars.py`: check for non-7-bit characters in files.
    -   `./bin/check_cites.py`: check for unused and undefined bibliographic citations.
    -   `./bin/check_figs.py`: check for unused and missing figures.
    -   `./bin/check_gloss.py`: check for unused and undefined glossary entries.
    -   `./bin/check_links.py`: check for unused and undefined links in `./_includes/links.md`.
    -   `./bin/check_src.py`: check for unused and missing source files in `./src/`.
    -   `./bin/check_toc.py`: check for unused or missing files compared to table of contents in `./_config.yml`.
    -   `./bin/cites.py`: handle citations during Markdown-to-LaTeX transformation (because `sed` can't do this one step).
    -   `./bin/transform.py`: handle HTML-to-intermediate-to-LateX transformation.
    -   `./bin/uncode.py`: remove code blocks (used in counting words).
    -   `./bin/util.py`: utilities used by other scripts.
-   `./assets/`: static files (CSS, JavaScript, images).
    -   `./assets/bootstrap.min.css`: [Bootstrap 4][bootstrap]
    -   `./assets/bootstrap.min.js`: [Bootstrap][bootstrap]
    -   `./assets/site.css`: custom definitions.
    -   `./assets/site.js`: used to clean up bibliographic citations and glossary entries, style tables, etc.
    -   `./assets/tango.css`: [Pygments Tango theme][pygments-tango]
-   `./etc/`: holding area for files that aren't being used right now but might be (re-)added later.
-   `./favicon.ico`: toolbar icon.
-   `./figures/`: [draw.io][draw-io] source for figures and all exported figures.
    -   `./figures/slug.xml`: source for all diagrams in that lesson.
    -   `./figures/slug_something.suffix`: PDF, PNG, or SVG export of a single figure from the XML file.
-   `./index.md`: overall home page for site (currently redirects to English-language version).
-   `./project/`: the running example used throughout the lessons.
    -   Put in a sub-directory so that it can be structured the way a real project would be.
-   `./requirements.txt`: Pip installation requirements.
    -   Run with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
-   `./src/`: source files used in Markdown, broken down by chapter.
-   `./tex/`: LaTeX files used to create PDF.
    -   `./tex/settings.tex`: package inclusions, macro definitions, etc.
    -   `./tex/lang/book.tex`: main file for book.
    -   `./tex/lang/book.bib`: BibTeX bibliography for book.
    -   `./tex/lang/all.tex`: if present, holds the all-in-one LaTeX generated from the Markdown source.
